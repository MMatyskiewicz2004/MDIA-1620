AHA moments
1. I understood the peanut butter demostration that computer don't "think" like us and need more logic to perform things
2. Justin's favorite sandwich is the chicago beef dip.
3. Learned how to use the command prompt to go through my files
-------------------------
Things that are unclear
1. What GitHub is used for. Notepad for sharing?
2. Are there anymore commands to the terminal that we can use beside going through files?
-------------------------
One word you're feeling
1. Nervous?
-----------------------
Github is just one place that you can use a user interface to view your changes
