AHA moments
1. I understood the peanut butter demostration that computer don't "think" like us and need more logic to perform things
2. Justin's favorite sandwich is the chicago beef dip.
3. Learned how to use the command prompt to go through my files
-------------------------
Things that are unclear
1. What GitHub is used for. Notepad for sharing?
2. Are there anymore commands to the terminal that we can use beside going through files?
-------------------------
One word you're feeling
1. Nervous?
-----------------------
Github is just one place that you can use a user interface to view your changes

AHA moments
1. I've learned how to using GitHub commits and uploads using the terminal.
2. Learned a little coding such as "let" and "console.log"
3. Learned about the Camel method thing where capital letters do matter when it comes to coding.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things you are unclear about
1. How to change my file back to "README" instead of it being just my name.
2. Using the terminal during the lab was a little confusing but I think it's just that I need practise to get the grasp of it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One word of how you're feeling
1. Excited or intrigued about what we are learning, a little lost sometimes but its been interesting.
